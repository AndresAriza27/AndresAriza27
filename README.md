    <p>👋🏽 Hello!👋🏽 I'm Julian Andres Ariza, a junior software developer passionate about creating web pages.

I have experience in implementing and consuming APIs, which enables me to integrate various functionalities into my web applications.</p>
    <p>✨ Furthermore, I am skilled in using Git, which allows me to work collaboratively and maintain efficient version control in my projects. I have junior-level knowledge of SQL, enabling me to store and retrieve data effectively.</p>
    <p>✅ I firmly believe in agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, as I value effective communication and iterative delivery of high-quality software. I have worked on individual projects for specific institutions, which has allowed me to develop problem-solving skills and teamwork.</p>
